# Strava Running Assistant
The Strava Running Assistant is a conversational web application that connects to Strava to help users explore, analyze, and generate running routes. It integrates the Strava API with OpenAI models to provide intelligent route suggestions, map visualization, and activity analysis through an interactive chat interface.

This project was developed by Group 32 for the course
“Large Language Models and Societal Consequences of Artificial Intelligence (1RT730)”
at Uppsala University, Period 1, 2025.
